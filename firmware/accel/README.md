the current 2200 steps/sec might be too aggressive and cause:
    Missed steps
    Vibrations
    Reduced accuracy

1500 steps/sec provides:
    Reliable operation
    Good speed (≈27°/sec for joint 1)
    Smooth motion
    800 steps/sec² acceleration prevents:
    Motor stalling
    Mechanical stress
    Control instability
